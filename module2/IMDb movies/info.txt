This module searches movies and actors in IMDb database.

Example call:
Python movie testare_filme.py the Revenant
testare_filme.py python actor Sebastian Stan

Movie returns: title, plot, genres, cast, director
Actor returns: name, bio (who is the actor), birth date, movies
 
Finnaly, we didn't use this module because the program returns output in 5-10 seconds.
I used only a small part of this module, to create a database with the top 10 movies on imdb.
